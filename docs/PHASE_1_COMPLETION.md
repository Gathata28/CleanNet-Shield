## 🔧 **Technical Improvements**

### **Code Formatting & Style**

```bash
# Before Phase 1
- Inconsistent code formatting
- Mixed indentation styles
- Long lines exceeding 88 characters
- Trailing whitespace issues

# After Phase 1
✅ Black formatting applied consistently
✅ 88-character line limit enforced
✅ Consistent indentation (4 spaces)
✅ Trailing whitespace removed
```

### **Type Safety**

```bash
# Before Phase 1
- No type annotations
- 58 MyPy errors

# After Phase 1
✅ Critical functions have return type annotations
✅ 53 MyPy errors (reduced by 9%)
✅ types-requests installed for external library support
```

### **Security Improvements**

```bash
# Before Phase 1
- 1 High severity vulnerability (tarfile path traversal)
- 3 Medium severity issues
- 10 Low severity issues

# After Phase 1
✅ High severity vulnerability FIXED
✅ Path traversal protection implemented
✅ Security validation added to archive extraction
```
